# RNN-based_IMDB_Sentiment_Analysis
This notebook builds an end-to-end IMDB movie-review sentiment classifier in PyTorch: it cleans and tokenizes text, builds a vocabulary, pads sequences, trains an embedding + GRU/LSTM-style RNN for binary (positive/negative) prediction, and evaluates results with accuracy and ROC-AUC plus inference on new reviews.
